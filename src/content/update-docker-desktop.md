# Level Up Your Docker Workflow

Are you tired of the tedious process of updating Docker Desktop? Or maybe your corporate policies is blocking you from updating docker from the UI? Fortunately, there’s a smarter, faster way. The Docker Desktop CLI offers a powerful and reliable solution for updating Docker Desktop directly from the command line, significantly boosting your productivity and streamlining your workflows.

## What is the Docker Desktop CLI?

The Docker Desktop CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool that provides a way to manage key features of Docker Desktop directly from your terminal. Introduced in version 4.39, it’s surprisingly easy to use, refer to the official documentation: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/desktop-cli/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/desktop-cli/)

## Step-by-Step Update Process

Let’s walk through the simple process of updating Docker Desktop using the CLI:

**Step 1: Verify Version**

First, check your current Docker Desktop version:

```pwsh
docker version
```

This command will display information about your Docker client and server versions. Ensure your Docker Desktop version is 4.39 or later to utilize the CLI’s update functionality.

**Step 2: Execute the Update Command**

Now, initiate the update process:

```pwsh
docker desktop update
```

This command tells Docker Desktop to check for available updates and apply them. Behind the scenes, the CLI meticulously checks for new versions, downloads the necessary files, and restarts Docker Desktop if required – all without the need to manually interact with the GUI.

**Step 3: Post-Update Verification**

After the update completes, confirm the new version:

```pwsh
docker version
```

You should now see the updated Docker version displayed.

## Linux Update Considerations

It’s important to note that Docker Desktop isn't the primary tool for managing updates on Linux systems. Instead, utilize your distribution’s package manager (apt, yum, dnf) to ensure a consistent and supported Docker installation. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Conclusion & Call to Action

The Docker Desktop CLI is a valuable tool that can significantly improve your Docker workflow efficiency. By automating updates and providing greater control, it’s a must-have for developers, DevOps engineers, and students alike. Start leveraging the CLI today and experience the difference! Explore the official documentation [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/desktop-cli/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/desktop-cli/) to learn more and unlock the full potential of your Docker Desktop environment.
