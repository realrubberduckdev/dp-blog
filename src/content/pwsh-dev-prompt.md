# Introduction
This post is more for my notes and hopefully helps someone out figure out how to set up [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) environment from [pwsh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) in [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

# Steps
- From windows terminal hit Ctrl+, to open settings pane. I normally use the json file.
![terminal-settings](./img/pwsh-dev-prompt/terminal-settings.png)<br/>
- **Default Profile:** Add pwsh profile as you default one
![default-wt-profile](./img/pwsh-dev-prompt/default-wt-profile.png)<br/>
- Then open `pwsh` and use command
```
code $PROFILE
```
This will open up the profile startup script
- Add the following to the profile startup script.
```
$vsInstallPath = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community"
Import-Module "$vsInstallPath/Common7/Tools/Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll"
Enter-VsDevShell -VsInstallPath $vsInstallPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -StartInPath "C:\Dev"
```
*Note:* The `StartInPath` parameter is for my local folder where I normally checkout code.
*Note:* This is specific to VS 2022. May need changing as per VS installation.
